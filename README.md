# Web-Scraper

This is essentially a 2-in-1 web scraping GUI that'll ask whether the user
would like to check on their Instagram account, or what the weather is like in a certain city. 

Must pip install Selenium (and Requests if you're on a UNIX-based OS). See requirements.txt for module versions, which I retrieved from my Mac with the 'pip3 freeze' command. This means that if you're on Windows or Linux, they'll differ slightly.
